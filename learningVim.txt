* in vim their are three modes of operation
1. command mode or normal mode(esc)
2. insert mode or edit mode(i , a , s , o , I , A , S , O , etc)

@ there are some importance things that --> 
I try to use edit or insert mode as vscode key binding mode
and use command mode as vim key binding mode

#1. normal mode -> command mode

in vim keybinding -> command + count + motion

in insert mode it is just like normal text editor

but it is not like "normal" text editor , there are some special keybinding in vim for other modes

command -> action 
    d -> "delete"
    y -> "yank" (copy)
    c -> "change"
    v -> "visual mode"
    R -> "replace mode"

count -> number of times to perform action
    3d -> delete 3 lines
    3y -> yank 3 lines
    3c -> change 3 lines
    3v -> visual mode 3 lines

motion -> where to perform action
    j -> down
    k -> up
    h -> left
    l -> right
    w -> word
    b -> back
    e -> end of the word
    etc (there are many more)

this visual command are different types (mostly 3 types)
1. visual mode (v)
2. visual line mode (shift + v)
3. visual block mode (ctrl + v)

some example of command in normal mode
    di" -> delete inside double quote
    ci" -> change inside double quote
    yi" -> yank inside double quote
    vi" -> visual mode inside double quote

Other then this type of motion there are some command. e.g.
gg -> go to top of the file
G -> go to bottom of the file
zz -> center the screen
0 -> go to start of the line
$ -> go to end of the line
^ -> go to first non blank character of the line
f -> find character in the line
F -> find character in the line in backward direction
t -> till character in the line
T -> till character in the line in backward direction
u -> undo
ctrl + r -> redo
. -> repeat last command
/ -> search
n -> next search
N -> previous search
% -> go to matching bracket
* -> search word under cursor
# -> search word under cursor in backward direction
: -> command line mode
    :w -> write
    :q -> quit
    :wq -> write and quit
    :q! -> quit without saving
    :wqa -> write and quit all
    :qa! -> quit all without saving
    :e -> edit
    :e! -> edit without saving
    :e filename -> edit filename
    :e! filename -> edit filename without saving
    :sp filename -> split window horizontally
    :vsp filename -> split window vertically
    :tabe filename -> open file in new tab
    :tabn -> go to next tab
    :tabp -> go to previous tab
    :tabclose -> close current tab
    :tabonly -> close all other tab
    :tabnew -> open new tab
    :tabfirst -> go to first tab
    :tablast -> go to last tab
    :tabmove n -> move current tab to nth position
    :tabdo command -> run command in all tab
    :tab ball -> ope

#2. normal mode -> insert mode
i -> insert before cursor
I -> insert at start of the line
a -> append after cursor
A -> append at end of the line
o -> open new line below current line
O -> open new line above current line
s -> substitute character under cursor
S -> substitute line
c -> change
C -> change till end of the line
r -> replace character under cursor
R -> replace mode
ctrl + o -> insert mode for one command
ctrl + t -> insert mode for one tab
ctrl + w -> delete word before cursor
ctrl + u -> delete line before cursor
ctrl + h -> delete character before cursor (I remove it from my vimrc)

#3. virtual mode -> command mode
d -> delete
y -> yank
c -> change
v -> visual mode
R -> replace mode
and all other command of normal mode
